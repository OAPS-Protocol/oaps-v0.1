🎯 Core Principle: Validity ≠ Quality

OAPS is a neutral registry. It verifies the existence, integrity, and source of a proof—not the quality or outcome of the work it represents. The protocol does not curate, approve, or reject proofs; it only enforces cryptographic and schema validity.

Validity (What OAPS Verifies) Quality (What OAPS Does NOT Verify)
✅ Proof existence at a specific time ❌ Correctness of findings or decisions
✅ Data integrity (hash is unaltered) ❌ Skill or competence of the attester
✅ Cryptographic signature of the source ❌ Safety or security of a system
✅ Immutable, on-chain timestamp ❌ Future performance or results

🎪 Core Use Cases

OAPS provides foundational infrastructure for verifying professional work across the on-chain economy, starting with audits and extending to new verticals.

1. 🔐 Audit & Security Proofs: The foundational use case. Create immutable, timestamped records for code audits, penetration tests, and security reviews.
2. 📚 Educational & Reference Proofs: Document the verification of canonical design patterns, reference implementations, or best practice examples.
3. 🏢 RWA & Compliance Attestations: Tokenization projects can register immutable proofs for off-chain legal reviews, valuation reports, and regulatory compliance checks.
4. 🤖 AI Agent Accountability: Autonomous agents can register verifiable proofs of task execution, creating an immutable decision and action trail for accountability.

🗺️ Protocol Roadmap & Architecture

OAPS is being developed as a sustainable, three-layer public good.

Layer A: Universal Proof Registry (The Protocol)

· The free, open-source, and neutral base layer.
· Provides an immutable record of proof hashes, signatures, and timestamps.
· Status: ✅ v0.1 Live on Sepolia.

Layer B: Credibility Oracle (Derived Reputation)

· An opt-in, transparent layer that reads from Layer A to compute track records and attestation histories.
· Provides data-driven insights, not qualitative ratings or guarantees.
· Status: 🔄 Research & Design (Q1 2026)

Layer C: Shadow Operator & Services (Sustainable Engine)

· Premium services built atop the protocol: dashboards, enterprise APIs, monitoring, and compliance tooling.
· Funds ongoing protocol development and growth.
· Status: 🔄 Formation & Pilot (Q1 2026)

❓ Troubleshooting

Issue Solution
MetaMask not detected Install/Enable the MetaMask browser extension
Wrong network Switch your wallet to the Sepolia Testnet
Invalid hash format Ensure the hash is 66 characters (e.g., 0x + 64 hex chars)
Transaction failed Check your Sepolia ETH balance for gas fees
Proof not found Verify the hash computation matches the OAPS specification
