# 🧠 OAPS Protocol — The Credibility Atom Protocol

> A neutral, adversarial substrate for trust.  
> Proof of Fact, Curated by Incentives.

OAPS defines a foundational primitive — the **Credibility Atom** — enabling the generation of non-transferable, history-dependent credibility signals for any agent (human or artificial) through economically bonded challenge games.

🚀 Live dApp — Operational Foundation

**OAPS Proof Builder & Registry (v0.1)**  
Build, sign, and register immutable proofs on the Sepolia testnet.

🔗 [Live dApp](https://oaps-signer-dapp.vercel.app)

This system constitutes Layer A (v0.1) of the protocol and demonstrates the complete end-to-end pipeline:

> Agent input → cryptographic commitment → on-chain settlement

The system is intentionally minimal, neutral, and judgment-free.

---

📜 Abstract — From Registry to Protocol

OAPS v0.1 established a neutral, on-chain proof-of-existence registry for professional claims (audits, attestations, task execution).

The **Credibility Atom Protocol** evolves this registry into a dynamic system where:

> Proofs are not endpoints — they are the opening state of an adversarial game.

⚛️ The Credibility Atom

A Credibility Atom is a cryptographically verifiable record of an agent’s completed action or claim that:

- is submitted with economic stake,
- is exposed to bonded challenge for a fixed window,
- is finalized only after adversarial scrutiny,
- produces a non-transferable, history-dependent credibility delta.

**Design Outcomes**

- Dishonesty becomes economically irrational
- Silence (no challenge) becomes a meaningful signal
- Trust is replaced by adversarial verification

> Validity ≠ Quality  
> Layer A never judges truth. It only settles incentives.

🧱 Layer Details

🔒 **Layer A — Credibility Atom Factory (Settlement Layer)**

**Function:** Immutable, judgment-free settlement layer where Credibility Atoms are minted, challenged, and economically resolved.

**Properties:**
- Explicit state machine: PENDING → FINALIZED / REJECTED
- Bonded challenge windows
- Deterministic economic outcomes

**Status:**
- ✅ v0.1 live: OAPSRegistryV0
- 🔜 v1 upgrade: bonded challenges + dispute resolution

**Core Principle:**  
> Brutal neutrality. Layer A never evaluates truth or quality.

---

🧮 **Layer B — Credibility Oracle (Intelligence Layer)**

**Function:** Consumes finalized Layer A events and computes credibility deltas.

**Constraints:**
- Non-transferable
- History-dependent
- Stake-weighted, game-resistant

**Key Design Choice:**  
Explainability over full transparency  
(framework public, weightings sovereign)

**Status:**  
🔄 RFC active — ACCREDITATION.md  
Reference oracle + open interface for competing models

---

🕶️ **Layer C — Shadow Operator Network (Sustainability Layer)**

**Function:** Provides premium, non-privileged services that sustain protocol security and adoption.

**Examples:**
- Automated challenge watchtowers
- High-throughput APIs & dashboards
- Adversarial simulation and stress testing

**Principle:**  
> Service without capture. No special rights over protocol logic.
