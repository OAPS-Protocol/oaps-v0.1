🧠 OAPS Protocol — The Credibility Atom Protocol

A neutral, adversarial substrate for trust.
Proof of Fact, Curated by Incentives.

OAPS defines a foundational primitive — the Credibility Atom — enabling the generation of non-transferable, history-dependent credibility signals for any agent (human or artificial) through economically bonded challenge games.

OAPS Proof Builder & Registry (v0.1)
Build, sign, and register immutable proofs on the Sepolia testnet.

🔗 Live dApp

This system constitutes Layer A (v0.1) of the protocol and demonstrates the complete end-to-end pipeline:

Agent input → cryptographic commitment → on-chain settlement

The system is intentionally minimal, neutral, and judgment-free.

📜 Abstract — From Registry to Protocol

OAPS v0.1 established a neutral, on-chain proof-of-existence registry for professional claims (audits, attestations, task execution).

The Credibility Atom Protocol evolves this registry into a dynamic system where:

Proofs are not endpoints — they are the opening state of an adversarial game.

⚛️ The Credibility Atom

A Credibility Atom is a cryptographically verifiable record of an agent’s completed action or claim that:

· is submitted with economic stake,
· is exposed to bonded challenge for a fixed window,
· is finalized only after adversarial scrutiny,
· produces a non-transferable, history-dependent credibility delta.

Design Outcomes

· Dishonesty becomes economically irrational
· Silence (no challenge) becomes a meaningful signal
· Trust is replaced by adversarial verification

Validity ≠ Quality
Layer A never judges truth. It only settles incentives.

🧱 Layer Details

🔒 Layer A — Credibility Atom Factory (Settlement Layer)

Function: Immutable, judgment-free settlement layer where Credibility Atoms are minted, challenged, and economically resolved.

Properties:

· Explicit state machine: PENDING → FINALIZED / REJECTED
· Bonded challenge windows
· Deterministic economic outcomes

Status:

· ✅ v0.1 live: OAPSRegistryV0
· 🔜 v1 upgrade: Bonded challenges + dispute resolution

Core Principle:

Brutal neutrality. Layer A never evaluates truth or quality.

---

🧮 Layer B — Credibility Oracle (Intelligence Layer)

Function: Consumes finalized Layer A events and computes credibility deltas.

Constraints:

· Non-transferable
· History-dependent
· Stake-weighted, game-resistant

Key Design Choice:
Explainability over full transparency
(Framework public, weightings sovereign)

Status:
🔄 RFC active — ACCREDITATION.md
Reference oracle + open interface for competing models

---

🕶️ Layer C — Shadow Operator Network (Sustainability Layer)

Function: Provides premium, non-privileged services that sustain protocol security and adoption.

Examples:

· Automated challenge watchtowers
· High-throughput APIs & dashboards
· Adversarial simulation and stress testing

Principle:

Service without capture. No special rights over protocol logic.
