Open Audit Proof Standard (OAPS) v0.1

OAPS is the on-chain proof layer for crypto audits — making audit reports verifiable, timestamped, and impossible to fake.

🚀 Quick Start

· Auditors: Build and register your first proof
· Projects: Verify audit proofs on-chain
· Developers: Review the technical specification

Why OAPS Exists

Most crypto audits are published as static PDFs that cannot be independently verified, timestamped, or cryptographically linked to an auditor.

OAPS introduces a neutral, protocol-level standard that allows anyone to verify:

· that an audit report existed at a specific time,
· that it has not been altered,
· and which auditor cryptographically signed it.

OAPS does not replace auditors.
It replaces unverifiable audit claims.

What OAPS Does

The Open Audit Proof Standard (OAPS) provides a canonical, machine-readable, and cryptographically verifiable format for publishing the results of a smart contract security audit. It separates proof of existence from judgment of quality.

What OAPS Is NOT

· OAPS is NOT an audit firm
· OAPS does NOT certify project safety
· OAPS does NOT guarantee correctness or prevent fraud
· OAPS does NOT provide investment advice

OAPS verifies proofs — not promises.

Core Principle: Validity ≠ Quality

An OAPS proof validates that a specific audit report exists and is unchanged. It does not guarantee the report's correctness, the auditor's skill, or the system's security. Trust is layered separately via the Accreditation Layer (Layer B).

🏛️ Governance & Funding

This protocol is governed by a strict Funding & Independence Charter (to be published) to ensure permanent neutrality and anti-capture. It is maintained by the OAPS-Protocol organization.

🔄 Three-Layer Architecture

Layer A: OAPS Protocol (Current - v0.1)

· Proof Registry - Immutable on-chain record of audit proofs
· Canonical Standard - Deterministic proof format and hashing
· Verification Protocol - Independent proof verification

Layer B: Accreditation (Next Phase)

· Verified auditor reputation system
· Decentralized trust layer
· Quality signaling separate from validity

Layer C: Shadow Operator (Funding Layer)

· Sustainable funding mechanism
· Protocol development funding
· Ecosystem services

🚀 Getting Started

For Auditors

1. Review the Getting Started Guide
2. Use the Proof Builder dApp to create and register proofs
3. Test with Sepolia ETH before mainnet usage

For Projects

1. Request OAPS-compliant audits from auditors
2. Verify proofs using the Sepolia registry
3. Integrate OAPS verification into your security documentation

For Developers

1. Review the technical specification
2. Audit the smart contract code
3. Contribute to tooling or documentation

Remember: OAPS establishes cryptographic truth, not subjective judgment.
Validity ≠ Quality – we verify proofs, not promises.

Trust is verifiable, not promised.
